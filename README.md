# Travel0 App Modernization Project

This sample demonstrates the integration of [Auth0 React SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react) into a React application created using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). The sample is a companion to the [Auth0 React SDK Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react).

This sample demonstrates the following use cases:

- [User Account Linking](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking)
- [Unverified Account Blocking using Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action#create-an-action)
- [Universal Login Customization](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/new-experience#flow-customization)
- [Social Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers)
